## Introduction

This project implements a CNN for classifying fashion items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using the Keras library. The CNN architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers. The model is trained and evaluated using this dataset to achieve accurate fashion item classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), a benchmark for machine learning models. It consists of grayscale images of various fashion items such as shirts, trousers, sneakers, etc. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fashion-MNIST-CNN.git
   cd Fashion-MNIST-CNN
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies.
2. Run the `fashion_mnist.py` script:

   ```bash
   python src/fashion_mnist.py
   ```

3. The script loads the Fashion-MNIST dataset, defines a CNN model, compiles it, trains it, and evaluates its performance.
